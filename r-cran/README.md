# R - R-cran a better S-plus

[R(-cran)](https://cran.r-project.org/) is the one of the most popular tool for data analysis. 

The script allows for updating `R` with  `apt-get` and install what I consider the most useful packages (cf. _packages.R_).

## Introduction to R

Coursera and Udacity offers great introduction to R. The ETHZ offers a quite good intermediate lecture in [Computational Statistics](https://stat.ethz.ch/education/semesters/ss2015/CompStat).
