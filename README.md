# new-ubuntu-config
Bash and makefiles for ubuntu new configurations (server and desktop)

## Ubuntu Server Configuration

A standard configuration makefiles for your server (or desktop).

[Digital ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=b86bf62163aa) provides
cheap cloud servers (you can start as low as 5$ per month).

As I am beginer in cloud server, but often have to reinstall my own Ubuntu
distribution, I decided to automate as much as possible with bash files. 

### Advantage for data analysis

As a bonus, you'll get the following bonus: 
+ my emacs configuration
+ A script for upgrading `R` (or `R-cran`) with your usual `apt-get` command.
+ For `python`, the  scipy kit (IPython, pandas, numpy, etc.) and scitkit.
+ Clojure and clojurescript (with lein).

### Nothing fancy

This has no intention to bring something new, it is much for educational purpose
and a good memo for myself or anyone who encounter the same challenge as me.
